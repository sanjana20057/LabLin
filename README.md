CS Amplifier:

> a common-source amplifier is one of three fundamental single-stage field-effect transistor (FET) amplifier configurations, most commonly employed as a voltage or transconductance amplifier. 

>In this case, the signal comes in on the gate, and goes out on the drain. The terminal in left is the source. This is a common-source FET circuit. The corresponding BJT circuit can be considered to be a transconductance amplifier or a voltage amplifier.

>Here input voltage controls the current through the FET, varying the voltage across the output resistance. But the output resistance of the FET device is usually not high enough to be a good transconductance amplifier, nor low enough to be a good voltage amplifier(zero).

key features:

>Gain:

The gain of a MOSFET is dependent on the transconductance and drain resistor value. The highest gain of an individual MOSFET is referred to as the intrinsic gain.

Transconductance: The transconductance depends on the bias point.

Drain resistor: The drain resistor value is directly proportional to the voltage gain of a MOSFET amplifier.

Intrinsic gain: The intrinsic gain is the highest gain of an individual MOSFET transistor. It is determined by the product of the transconductance and the output impedance of the MOSFET.

Gain at low frequency: The gain at low frequency is influenced by coupling capacitors.

Gain at high frequency: The gain at high frequency is lowered by parasitic capacitance.

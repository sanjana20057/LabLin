A Common Source (CS) amplifier is a fundamental MOSFET-based amplifier configuration commonly used in analog electronics. It offers voltage amplification with moderate gain and functions similarly to the common-emitter amplifier in BJTs.

Working of a CS Amplifier
 1. Circuit Components:
 • MOSFET (typically an n-channel)
 • Input signal (AC source applied at the gate)
 • Drain resistor ( R_D )
Source resistor (R_S, sometimes bypassed with a capacitor C_S)
 • Load resistor ( R_L )
Biasing resistors (R_G1, R_G2) are essential for proper MOSFET operation.
• Coupling capacitors (C_{in}, C_{out}) for AC signal transfer
 2. Operation Steps: The AC input signal is applied to the gate of the MOSFET via a coupling capacitor.
The gate-source voltage (V_{GS}) controls the drain current (I_D) according to the MOSFET's transfer characteristics.
Due to negative transconductance, an increase in V_{GS} leads to an increase in I_D, causing a larger voltage drop across R_D. This results in an inverted output signal at the drain.
The output voltage (V_{out}) is derived from the drain terminal.
The gain of the amplifier is influenced by the MOSFET's transconductance (g_m) and the load resistance.


Key Features:
•	Voltage Gain: A_v = - g_m R_D  (assuming an ideal CS amplifier with zero source degeneration).
•	Phase Inversion: The signal at the output is inverted to that at the input.
•	High Input Impedance: Owing to the gate of the MOSFET with a near infinite resistance.
•	Moderate Output Impedance: Varies with  R_D  and the MOSFET's output resistance.

Applications:
•	Audio and RF amplifiers
•	Amplication of sensor signals
•	Buffer circuits in analog applications
•	Series active loads in integrated circuits
